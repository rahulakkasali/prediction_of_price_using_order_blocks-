Order Book Price Prediction

>This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict the next price movement in financial markets using order book features.

📌 Project Overview

>An order book contains the list of buy and sell orders in a market, giving deep insights into liquidity, demand, and supply. By extracting meaningful features from the order book (such as bid-ask spread, mid-price, depth imbalance, and volume dynamics), this project builds an ML-based predictive model that forecasts the next price.
